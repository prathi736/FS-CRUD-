# 🗂 CRUD Operations

I have created Full-Stack CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations using React, TailwindCSS, FastAPI and Postgresql. I have used React and TailwindCSS to build Front-End of the application. I have also used FastAPI to create an API connection with Postgresql as a database to store the values entered by the user.


## 👨‍💻 Tech Used 

**Tool(s):** VS Code, Git, Chrome Browser, PostgreSQL

**Programming Language(s):** React, Tailwind CSS, Python, FastAPI
